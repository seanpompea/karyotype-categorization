CYTOGENETICS, KARYOTYPES, AND ISCN NOTATION

==============================================[ Cytogenetics and Cell Division ]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ * Basic Terms *

cytogenetics:
chromosome:
chromatin:
chromatid:
homologue: one part of a chromosome pair (eg 'chromosome 21 homologues')
diploid: have a pair of each chromosome (e.g., somatic cell)
haploid: have only one of each chromosome (e.g., sex cell aka gamete)
aneuploid: "involve gains or losses of less than an entire haploid set of 23
chromosomes" (AGT p429). E.g., trisomy 21 (a single extra chromosome).
euploidy: "used to refer to the loss or gain of one or more entire haploid sets
of 23 chromosomes" (AGT p429). Examples:
  - triploid: contains 96 chromosomes
  - tetraploid: has 92 ("two extra haploid sets" (AGT p429)).
  - Hyperdiploidy: greater than 48 chromosomes
Centromere: Dividing pivot of the chromosome
telomere:
p arm: short arm of a chromosome
q arm: the long arm of a chromosome.

acrocentric: "Having the centromere located near one end of the chromosome so
that one chromosomal arm is long and the other is short." -- wordnik


mosaic vs nonmosaic:
  - mosaic means a person has two or more genotypes of cells; 
  the detection of an abnormality could be considered 'less serious' if it comes
  from a mosaic individual vs a nonmosaic individual.
  - "The presence of two or more cell lines within a single individual, each of
  which is derived from the same original cell line, represents mosaicism. When
  the abnormal cell line is distributed throughout the body along with a normal
  cell line, a generalized mosaicism is said to be present and the clinical
  phenotype is often milder than that seen in association with the comparable
  nonmosaic aneuploidy." (AGT p438).

meiosis:
  - "only occurs in germ cells" (AGT p430)

AML: acute myeloid leukemia (blood cancer)
MDS: myelodysplastic syndromes
MF: myelofibrosis

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* Mitosis -- Cell Division *

4 phases:
  1. Prophase
    "Chromatin condenses into chromosomes." (Nav 4)
  2.Metaphase:
    Chromosomes line up at equatorial plate
  3.Anaphase
  4. Telophase

=======================================[ Chomosome Abnomalities & ISCN Symbols ]

- constitutional vs acquired: constitutional means effectively from birth
  whereas 

== numerical abnormality ===

trisomy: addition of a whole chromosome
- "only the nonmosaic trisomies involving chromosomes 13, 18, and 21, as well
as three sex chromosome trisomies, XXX, XXY, and XYY, are considered to be
compatible with survival." (AGT p430)

monosomoy: loss of a whole chromosome
- monosomy X is only survivable monosomy.

"When normal chromosomes are replaced by structurally altered chromosomes, the
normal ones should not be recorded as missing." (AGT p365).

== structural abnormality ==

Structural abnormalities include deletion, inversion, etc.

~~~~~~~~~~
*add :: addition
- "Added material on chromosomes is material that is unidentifiable as to its
chromosomal origin and which is translocated to a known chromosome."
(CA p90).
- eg: 
    46,XY,add(14)(q32) 
    "added material on the long arm of chromosome 14"
    (AC p90)

~~~~~~~~~~
*del :: deletion: "associated with myelodysplastic syndromes and acute myeloid
leukemia"; lots of lost genes as a result (Nav 14).
  - eg: del(5)(q21q34)

~~~~~~~~~~
:: dmin -- "double minute"
See AGT 8.7.8 p402, and also p424.
intra? TODO

Ex: (AGT p402)
46,XY,5dmin[20] using an absolute numerical value indicates that all cells had 5 dmins;
46,XY,~22dmin[20] indicates that the cells showed approximately 22 dmins (as a mean number) per cell
 46,XY,5~ 22dmin[20]


~~~~~~~~~~
*inv :: inversion:
  paracentric inversion: inversion of a segment on a single arm.
  pericentric inversion: inversion of a segment that includes centromere.
  eg: inv(3)(q24q27)

~~~~~~~~~~
*inverted duplication (inv dup):
- "The isodicentric 15q is also described as an inverted duplication (inv dup)
and may be written either way. However, recent studies have shown a possible
mechanism of this chromosome as the consequence of recombination of homologous
chromosome 15s; therefore, idic is probably a better choice for the
nomenclature." (CA p101). 

~~~~~~~~~~
:: fis -- centris fission
:: intra

Not covered in AGT ch 8.
See: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2693553/
Ex (from link);

    47,XX,-11,+fis(11)(p10),+fis(11)(q10)

~~~~~~~~~~
*isodicentric (idic):
TODO
See AC pp101, 102.

~~~~~~~~~~
*translocation (t):
  balanced: a translocation as one would intuit.
  unbalanced: not sure exactly what this means yet
  eg: t(9;22)(q34;q11)
      t(8;9;11)(q12;p24;p12) (humpath.com)

~~~~~~~~~~
*dicentric chromosome (dic):
See Dav 19.
Results when two segments from unique chromosomes, both containing a
centromere, attach together. The other material (from the original chromosomes)
are considered deleted material.

~~~~~~~~~~
*i :: isochromosome:
See Dav 20., CA p98.
Two chromosomes split at their centromeres, the parts swap and two new 
chromosomes develop; the first is the combined q arms, the other is the combined
p arms.
- Mosaic isochromosome (12p) -- Pallister–Killian syndrome 
    47,XX,+i(12)(p10)[12]/46,XX[8]
  " extra isochromosome consisting of the short arm of chromosome 12,
  resulting in tetrasomy (4 copies)" (AC p99).
- seems to qualify as numerical: "The i(12p) is associated with
  Pallister–Killian syndrome and is generally seen as a supernumerary
  chromosome, thereby resulting in tetrasomy 12p, and is predominantly seen in the
  mosaic form." (AC p98).
- isochromosome 21:
    46,XX,i(21)(q10).
  (AC p100)

~~~~~~~~~~
*psu dic :: pseudodicentric
See AGT 8.5.2 p383
eg from AGT p383:
  45,XY,psu dic(20;17)(q11.2;q11.2)
  "The centromere of chromosome 20 is the only active one; therefore, it will be
  described first in the short karyotype, irrespective of karyotype order
  priority."

~~~~~~~~~~
*r :: ring chromosome:
See Dav 21.
A single chromosome with some deleted material at both ends -- that is, two
breaks in the chromosome -- forms a ring due two both ends adhesing to each other. 

See also: '+r', which is ring of unknown origin, below.

~~~~~~~~~~
*dup -- duplication:
See Dav 22.
One or more segments of a chromosome are repeated (within the chromosome).

~~~~~~~~~~
*der -- derivative:
See Dav 23.
"Used when only one chromosome of a translocation is present or
One chromosome has two or more structural abnormalities"




~~~~~~~~~~
Robertsonian translocation:
- "Robertsonian translocation (ROB) is the most common form of chromosomal
rearrangement in humans where the participating chromosomes break at their
centromeres and the long arms fuse to form a single, large chromosome with a
single centromere. In humans, Robertsonian translocations generally occur in the
five acrocentric chromosome pairs, namely 13, 14, 15, 21 and 22."
(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robertsonian_translocation)
- Example kar:
    
    46~49,XX,+8[26],der(13;21)(q10;q10)[21],+16[17],+21[17][cp30]

  The above includes:
    - gain of chromosomes 8, 16 and 21
    -  a robertsonian translocation between the long arms of chromosomes 13 and 21.

  -- from: CA p108.
- sometimes might use 'rob' symbol (apparently; see IR).


~~~~~~~~~~
:: *Question-mark '?' symbol: 

  46,XY,del(5)(p?15.1)   (AGT p397)

~~~~~~~~~~
:: 'inc':
"The incomplete (inc) symbol at the end indicates that additional
inconsistencies were also being questioned, but could not be definitively or
clonally identified at this time. " (AGT 398).

  47,XY,+3,-7,-20,+der(?)t(?;1)(?;p11.2),+mar,inc[20] (AGT p398)

Presence of ',inc' slug is sufficient to increment abn count.

~~~~~~~~~~
:: 'or':
  eg., 46,XY,add(16)(p13.3 or q24) (AGT p399)

~~~~~~~~~~
:: '~': Approximation (~) range
  eg 
    46,XY,del(16)(p13.1~13.3) (AGT p400)

~~~~~~~~~~
:: '+r':  Rings of unknown origin (r) (AGT 8.7.6)
  Can have multiple, eg +3r
  examples:
    47,XY,-18,+21,+r
    48,XY,-18,+3r[20]
    48,XY,+r1,+r2[20]
      -- In the above, two rings are clonally distingiushable
         so they are 'subscripted' , AGT p401
    49,XY,+r1x2,+r2[20]
      -- Similary, in the above, two ring types, but there are 
         two copies of the first variation, so it is indicate
         with 'x' indicating 'multiply' and then '2'. AGT 401

~~~~~~~~~~
*'+mar': "marker" is a chromosome of unknown origin (AGT 8.7.7 p401)
  Has similar syntax variations to '+r' above.

'''

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Derivatives
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

See AGT p396.
The 'der' token is often followed with further information -- i.e., a structural
event. Other times, it doesn't. Whole-arm derivates are situations where 
the token is standalone:
  o acrocentric whole-arm translocations

      45,XY,der(13;21)(q10;q10)           -- AGT 396
      46,XY,der(13;21)(q10;q10),+21       -- AGT 397
      46,XY,der(13;21)(q10;q10),+21       -- AGT 398
  
  o Nonacrocentric whole arm derivative

      46,XX,+9,der(9;18)(p10;q10)

In both cases, the presence of the '+9' or '+21' slug is sufficient to 
count as an abnormality.


Derivative Symbols

   'der':   'derivative'              # AGT 8.6 p 394
  ,'ider':  'isoderative'             # AGT 8.6.3 p 395
  ,'neo':   'neoderivative'           # AGT 

Note: analysis of WCM dataset shows _no_ usage of 'neo'.




=============================================[Chromosome Preparation Techniques]

o "karyotyping of neoplastic cells is currently a mandatory investigation for
all newly diagnosed leukemias, owing to its usefulness in diagnosis,
classification, and prognostication" (CCG 2)

o "It has overcome many of the drawbacks of chromosome analysis, such as poor
qual- ity metaphases of cancer cells, low mitotic index, low specimen cell
yield, and other unpredictable technical difficulties." (CCG 2).

o Who does this? A clinical cytogeneticist working in a lab.
  - https://www.genome.gov/genomiccareers/career.cfm?id=11
  - Requires an MD or PhD + board certification.
    - https://www.genome.gov/genomiccareers/career.cfm?id=11
  - "The main goal of the cancer cytogenetic laboratory is to select
    appropriate FISH techniques that are most useful and informative for a
    particular study and perform thorough analyses to arrive at an interpretation
    that is useful for research and diagnostic purposes." (CCG 7)

"Although conventional staining may seem outdated, its value should not be
overlooked. For example, it can be very useful in studying certain structural
abnormalities, such as, satellite presence (single or multiple), dicentric
chromosomes, ringchromosomes, fragments, double minutes, fragile sites, breaks
and gaps. " (AGT p219-220)

o Molecular Cytogenetics and FISH (Fluorescence in situ hybridization)
  - "Molecular cytogenetics involves the use of a series of FISH and FISH-based
    techniques, in which DNA probes are labeled with different colored
    fluorophores to visualize one or more specific regions of the genome" (CCG 5)
  - can help detect numerical + structural abnormalities
  - very useful in prognosis of hematologic cancers (CCG 5)
  - "has greatly enhanced the effi- ciency and accuracy of karyotype analysis
    by supplementing the technical pitfalls of karyotyping and molecular
    genetic technologies" (CCG 2)
  - " particularly indispensable when karyotypic analysis may be difficult in
    the largely quiescent cells of certain hematologic malignancies such as the
    chronic lymphoid disorders." (CCG 5)

o PCR (polymerase chain reaction)




=====================================================================[concepts]

* composite karyotype *




======================================================[ More on ISCN Notation ]

SEE ALSO: Chromosomal Abnormalities (above).

ISCN stands for: International System for Human Cytogenomic Notation.
o It is more than just 'karyotypes' as it covers FISH and "genomic (SNP-based
microarray" as well. (CCG 303).
o " In the clinical cytogenetics community, interpretation and sci- entific
communication is often facilitated by universally accepted nomenclature with
precisely defined terms and syntax conventions that minimize complexity and add
precision to the process." (CCG 8)
o ISCN 2016 version: "offers standard nomencla- ture that is used to describe
any genomic rearrangement identified by techniques ranging from karyotyping to
FISH, microarray, vari- ous region-specific assays, and DNA sequencing" (CCG 9)
o Debate: "whether two cells with the same loss of a single chromosome or one
cell with a gain of a single chromosome in a composite karyotype should be
counted and included in the size of the clone is still contradictory among
different laboratories all over the world since then" (CCG 9)

At a high level (Dav 24):

In sequence:
– the overall number of chromosomes identified
– sex chromosomes
– affected chromosomes
– type of abnormalities described in shorthand
– chromosomal band location
– In brackets, the number of cells with a given karyotype

Simple examples (Dav 24):

46, XX; t(9;22)(q13;q22) [20]
47, XY; +21 [12]
46, XX; inv 16(q13; q21) [20]
45, XY; -5 [18]; 46, XY [2]
46, XY; -5 (q13) [4]; 46, XX [16]

Comment on above examples: 
- 3rd example does not use parantheses around the '16' (just after 'inv').
- the above 5 kars has spaces in them; suggestion: remove all spaces
as a final prep step before parsing. 

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* various abbrevations *
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

:: idem, sl, sdl 

"The abbreviations idem, sl, sdl include the sex-chromosomes, and therefore the
sex chromosomes are not described again" (CCG 304)

idem and sl appear to be equivalent, per AGT 8.9.4 p406.

:: cp

Every effort should be taken to describe the clones and sub-clones so that
clonal evolution is evident. However, in case this is not possible one can use
the composite karyotype (cp)." (CCG 305)

:: de novo
- "Designates a chromosome abnormality which has not been inherited." (IR p2).

:: "LOH" -- loss of heterozygosity

'''
See AGT 8.5.13 p 394. Not an event but a descriptor
that is associated with upd event.
Notably, AGT does not provide an example.
'''

:: "dir dup" -- direct duplication

'''
You occasionally see the event symbol 'dir dup'
in literature for a detailed karyotype. 
E.g., partial trisomy 21 (Down syndrome) might
have a kar of:
    46,XY,dir dup(21)(qll.205-+q22.300) 
Source: Rahmani et al. Critical role of the D21S55 region on chromosome 21 in
the pathogenesisofDown syndrome. 1989.

Analysis of WCM data set shows _no_ usage of this symbol.
'''

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
# Symbols describing constitutional origin, etc.#
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
# See AGT 8.5.8 p 388
'''
These symbols annotate an abnormality with 'metadata', in essence.

"These symbols of parental origin are generally placed without a space directly
after the event's description, [...] however, "a space will be used when it
follows another symbol, for example, +r mat."

    eg: 46,XY,del(22)(q11.2q11.2)mat

    '+r mat' means ring of unknown origin, but of maternal provenance.

They include:
  mat               -- maternal
  pat               -- paternal
  inh               -- inherited but not sure which
  dn (or 'de novo') -- neither birth parent
  c                 -- constitutional

"Neoplastic karyotypes will use a "c" to distinguish a constitutional event,
for example, +21c"
'''



~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* out of scope (for trad karyo parsing) *
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

:: ish, nuc ish

:: arr (i.e., array nomenclature)

Ex: arr(1-22)x2,(XY)x1

A longer example: 
  arr 4q32.2q35.1(163,146,681-183,022,312)x1
This is 'Deletion of 4q' (apparently). (Camp deck p26).

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
chrom/arm/band syntxx
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

From AGT p 363:

  7q11.21
  .... .^--------- Level within sub-band
  ...  ^---------- Sub-band
  .. ^------------ Landmark band 
  . ^------------- Landmark region
   ^-------------- Arm
  ^--------------- Chromosome

"Band 7q11.2 demonstrates the breakdown of a sub‐band into three further band
levels: q11.21, q11.22, and q11.23" (AGT p363).
... meaning, 11.2 is not distinct from 11.21, but rather the former is broader/
less-specific.

  



====================================================[karyotype string examples]



```````````
o "53 year old man presented with pancytopenia and was found to have acute
erythroleukaemia" (Camp deck pp22-23)

Ways of describing:

  46,XY,inv(11)(p15q23)[7]/46,XY[13]

  46,XY,inv(11)(p15q23)[7]/46,XY[13].ish inv(11)(p15)(3’MLL+)(q23)(5’MLL+,3’MLL+)

  46,XY,inv(11)(p15q23)[7]/46,XY[13].ish inv(11)(p15)(3’MLL+)(q23)(5’MLL+,3’MLL+).nuc ish(5’MLLx2,3’MLLx3)(5’MLL con 3’MLLx2)

(Note: original source has a carriage return between '.' and 'nuc' in the 3rd
example.)

Comment: for simple karyotype parsing, we would search for the presence of
'ish' (or perhaps 'nuc ish') and cut from there to end of string. 

```````````
o "Patient with MDS" (Camp deck p27)

  46,XY,del(20)(q11.2)[20].arr 5q31.2(137,736,066x2,137,782,447‐138,987,704x1,139,017,982x2),20q11.22q11.32(33,785,207x2,33,852,818‐56,767,187x1,56,698,692x2)

Comment: here, for karparsing, index of '.arr' onward can be cut.

```````````
o array karyotype

Example (Camp deck 28) -- this is just a portion of an array karyotype:
  2p11.2(89,315,265‐89,325,297)x0,2p11.2(89,613,887‐89,624,078)x0,

Comment: this shows that karparsing (via regex or other) should make sure that
the paranthesis is present and facing the correct direction to prevent 'false
positive' in the case of eg the above array example.


==========================================[Significant Chromosomal Abnomalities]

o Philadelphia (Ph) Syndrome
  - t(9:22) on Ph chromosome.
  - hallmark of CML (chronic myeloid leukemia)  (CCG 1)
  - discovery in 1960 "showed for the first time that cancer resulted from a
    specific genetic abnormality" (CCG 1)
  - imatinib -- life-saver for CML.
    - brandname: Glivec.

o Turner Syndrome
  - Loss of second X chromosome
  - "greater than 99% of all conceptions die in utero" (AGT p430)
  - Kar: 45,X
      variation: 45,X0
  - ref: https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/turner-syndrome

o Down Syndrome
  - addition of an extra chromosome 21. (trisomy 21).
  - eg:  47,XX,+21
  - A trisomy 21 situation rsulting in Down's can occur from an 
    isochrosomome abnormality, eg:
      46,XX,i(21)(q10).
    (source: AC p100). The above kar is an iso of the long arm (that is, the q
    arm).

o Edwards Syndrome - trisomy 18

o Patau Syndrome - trisomy 13

o Klinefelter Syndrome
  - male with 2+ chromosomes
  - Eg: 47,XXY
  - a kind of trisomy; generally not harmful to health.

o acute promyelocytic leukemia (M3)
favorable prognosis
t(15; 17)(q22;q12)

o AML,subtype M4eo
favorable prog
inv(16)(p13;q22)

o acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL)

o Chronic myeloid leukemia
t(9;22)(q11;q34)

o myelodysplastic syndromes
ref: https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/5q-minus-syndrome
5q- syndrome
- this MDS associated with isolated del(5q31-33) chromosome
abnormality; is a subtype of low-risk MDS. (Source:
https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/chromosome-5q-deletion-syndrome)
Comment: 'del(5q31-33) appears to be shorthand; is it valid ISCN?

o Cri du Chat Syndrome
